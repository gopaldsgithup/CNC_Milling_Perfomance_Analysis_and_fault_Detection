CNC Milling Performance Analysis and Fault Detection


ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on analyzing CNC milling machine performance and detecting faults using deep learning techniques. The primary objective is to predict tool wear condition, machining finalization status, and passed visual inspection using time-series sensor data collected from CNC milling experiments. The project includes data collection, preprocessing, deep learning model training (LSTM), and deployment via Streamlit.
